# Widgets CRUD API with Tornado

This is a simple CRUD REST API or managing "Widgets." Widgets have properties, such as Name, Number of Parts, Created Date, and Updated Date, and they are persisted in a SQLite Database.

## Setup

1. Prepare the pre-requisite environment of Python 3.11 with SQLite support

2. Install the required packages:

   pip install tornado peewee apscheduler

3. Configure desired settings for the server by updating values in the server_config.py file.

## Usage

1. Create at least one API key to include in RESTful requests as the X-API-Key header parameter:

   python users.py create <user_name>

   API keys may be deleted by: python users.py delete <user_name>

   API keys may be regenerated by: python users.py regen <user_name>

2. Start the Tornado server by running the 'server.py' script:

   python server.py

   To start the Tornado server and clear the database of all Widgets and API keys, include the command line argument "--clear"

## API Endpoints

- `GET /widget/{widget_id}`: Retrieve a specific Widget by ID.
- `DELETE /widget/{widget_id}`: Delete a specific Widget by ID.
- `PUT /widget/{widget_id}`: Update a specific Widget by ID.
- `GET /widget`: Retrieve a list of all Widgets.
- `POST /widget`: Create a new Widget.

The request and response bodies should be in JSON format and the X-API-Key header parameter must contain a valid API key
